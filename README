Do you think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different customers or products?

Yes, I do think the mean helpfulness value may differ significantly between different customers or products. The helpfulness score is the number of times a review has been marked as helpful. For products that are more popular, their helpfulness scores are bound to be significantly higher than less popular products. The same applies to customers as certain customers may buy more niche products that fewer people may look at.
